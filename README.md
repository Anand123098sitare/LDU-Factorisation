# LDU Factorization of a n*n Matrix

This project implements the LDU factorization of a given square matrix. LDU factorization decomposes a matrix \( A \) into three matrices: a lower triangular matrix \( L \), a diagonal matrix \( D \), and an upper triangular matrix \( U \). This decomposition is useful in various applications, including solving linear systems and numerical analysis.


## Features
Step-by-step computation of LDU factorization.
- Visualization of intermediate steps for better understanding.
- User-friendly input for matrices of any dimension.
- Calculation of the inverse of the lower triangular matrix \( L \).
- Extraction of diagonal matrix\( D \) and upper triangular matrix\( U \)
